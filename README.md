## üõ† Development Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server

## üöÄ Hosting

This is a NextJS project so I use Vercel for hosting as it makes things easy for me. Feel free to use other hosting platforms. Pushing to this repo automatically updates the vercel deployment.

## üö® Forking this repo and copying code

I encourage you to do it. Let me know if you do. Also feel free to create pull requests if you think you've made an improvement.

If you copied the whole thing, giving some credit would be nice but I can't force you to do it.
