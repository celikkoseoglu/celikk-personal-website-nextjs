# Airpods Pro - the end of wired earphones

### Earphones have come a long way. It's about time we forget about the headphone jack.

###### May 17, 2020 - 10 min read

Before I discovered to the world of wireless headphones, I had a pair
of Marshall Major wired on-ear headphones. I used the Marshalls at
home. For everything else, I carried [Apple EarPods](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMTN2ZM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector?fnode=b9f40b0651e17bde6942ee565419f9f23ec9438f9d6c9414c21023d3a8592c56057e5f09f24277dab5a84030a5cfdda1a342d14296424818031081cff59fa96c0047942549e217befc270af9379882cbce0b96be9f27ff0429b1e93980c44a6bce8d8580ea73d31c07da0eba5b1cb5e6a75a1be8434c99f11a782e9686ef5f3f)
in my pocket.

I have to admit that I was a bit late to join the bluetooth headphones
party. I got my WH-1000XM3s only last year. It was my first pair of
bluetooth headphones. About after a week with the WH-1000XM3s, I stopped
carrying wired earpods. Noise cancelling was great for morning
commutes in London. Battery life was so good that I never had to care
about it. Returning back to wired headphones was not an option for
me anymore.

However, the WH-1000XM3s are huge and can't be carried around easily. This
made me want in-ear noise cancelling alternatives. Around the same time
I started my search, Apple launched AirPods Pro. The reviews were all
good so I decided to give it a try.

 <MediaCarousel folder="airpodsPro" images="sizeComparison.jpg"/>

In this blog post, I will be talking about my overall experience with
Apple's AirPods Pro. The following list is ordered by importance to me.

#### 1) Comfort

Earphones will stay in your ears for quite some time. They need to feel
comfortable enough so they don't distract you from doing your work.

I found AirPods Pro to be very uncomfortable during the first week, but
then I stopped feeling the pain. I don't know how that works, but
trust me, the pain is gone. I'm not the only one who says this. There
are plenty of posts over [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/dpmg5z/airpods_pro_hurt_my_ears_like_crazy_anyone_else/)
and [macrumours](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-hurt.2208685/)
discussing comfort issues.

When you put the AirPods in, they sit on top of the anti-tragus area that I
highlighted on the picture below:

 <MediaCarousel folder="airpodsPro" images="inEar.jpg"/>

During my first week, AirPods
made this area feel a bit painful. I had to take them out every 30
minutes and rest my ears. I imagine this would be a bigger issue if
you have small ears.

They are also physically much bigger compared to original AirPods. If you
feel uncomfortable with those ones, AirPods Pro are probably going to
feel worse. Make sure you try them before buying!

#### 2) Sound quality is good

I am not an audiophile but I have witnessed the sound quality of WH-1000XM3s.
Even though they can't even come close to WH-1000XM3s, I never felt like
I need to immediatelly switch to WH-1000XM3s. They don't quite shake your
brain like the WH-1000XM3s do, but they do sound amazing given their size.

#### 3) Noise cancelling is as good as it gets for earphones this size

Once you get used to noise cancelling headphones, there is no going back.
At the time of writing, WH-1000XM3s have the best noise cancelling on the
market. When walking around in London, or when in the tube (underground,
metro, subway), there is no way anything can match the WH-1000XM3s. I
would say AirPods Pro are 60% as good as the of WH-1000XM3s in this area.
I have no scientific way of measuring this at home though.

AirPods Pro provide good levels of noise cancellation considering their size.
If you never tried noise cancelling headphones before, you'll be amazed how
good these things are.

#### 4) Connectivity and switching between devices

Here are the instructions on how to switch between devices on WH-1000XM3s:

1. Turn off the headphones by holding the power button for 5 seconds
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Hold the side button for 10 seconds to enter bluetooth Pairing mode
4. Connect to WH-1000XM3s on your device's bluetooth settings

On AirPods it goes like this:

1. Connect to AirPods on your device's bluetooth settings

I don't understand why this was such a big issue for WH-1000XM3s. This feature
alone makes the AirPods a lot more convenient to use compared to the WH-1000XM3s.

#### 5) Microphone quality

When it comes to microphone quality, AirPods are much better than WH-1000XM3s.
The WH-1000XM3s are [well known](https://youtu.be/ejqzxaaNltI?t=573)
to have the worst microphone on this planet.
Overall, I have to say I'm very impressed by the AirPods in terms of
picking up sound. You will have no trouble even if you're in a loud
environment with the AirPods Pros.

Keep in mind most bluetooth headphones in the market still can't replace wired alternatives.
In my testing I found the [good old wired EarPods](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMTN2ZM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector?fnode=b9f40b0651e17bde6942ee565419f9f23ec9438f9d6c9414c21023d3a8592c56057e5f09f24277dab5a84030a5cfdda1a342d14296424818031081cff59fa96c0047942549e217befc270af9379882cbce0b96be9f27ff0429b1e93980c44a6bce8d8580ea73d31c07da0eba5b1cb5e6a75a1be8434c99f11a782e9686ef5f3f)
mics to be much better in terms of microphone quality.

For calls, AirPods are absolutely fine, but if you're thinking about streaming or
making a YouTube video, just use the wired ones. I use [Rode smartLav+](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-smartLav-Lavalier-Microphone-Smartphones/dp/B00EO4A7L0/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=rode+lavalier+mic&qid=1589753087&sr=8-2)
for my videos and streams.

#### 6) Controls and the lack of them

I have one big thing to complain in here. How come we don't have volume controls
built in? I don't want to be awkward and say "Hey Siri, volume down" in public.
I'd very much rather have physical controls to adjust volume levels. What's
weird is, AirPods let you control almost everything except volume levels.

So, Apple has built in squeeze controls on the AirPods Pro. Here is how I adjusted
mine to work:


* Squeezing left/right once: Play/Pause
* Squeezing left/right twice: Skip song
* Squeezing left-right three times: Previous Song
* Squeeze and hold left: Toggle between noise cancelling and transparency modes
* Squeeze and hold right: Activate Siri


 <MediaCarousel folder="airpodsPro" images="singleSqueeze.mp4,doubleSqueeze.mp4,tripleSqueeze.mp4,squeezeAndHold.mp4,takingOut.mp4"/>

These settings can be adjusted by going into Settings -> bluetooth -> AirPods Pro.
It's a shame that you can't assign triple squeeze right to decrease the volume.

 <MediaCarousel folder="airpodsPro" images="bluetoothSettings1.png,bluetoothSettings2.png"/>

#### 7) Battery Life and Charging Case

I found the battery life to be about 4 hours with noise cancelling when listening
to music at 50% volume. If you're using the microphones, battery life drops to
about 3 hours. This is great considering the physical size of AirPods. Plus,
putting them inside the charging case for 5 minutes will give you an additional
hour of listening time. These things charge fast!

The charging case is able to fully recharge AirPods about 4-5 times. Battery life
will not be an issue. The case is pretty much the best thing about the design. It
is almost no bigger than a pack of dental floss. It is glossy so it comes in and
out of your pocket with ease. The flap on the top feels solid and will not open
on its own. The case indicates battery level and charging status using the led
light.

 <MediaCarousel folder="airpodsPro" images="case1.jpg,case2.jpg,case3.jpg,case4.jpg"/>

However, if you are on an international flight for over 4 hours and you're sleeping,
make sure you grab your WH-1000XM3s for that 25 hours of continuous noise cancelling.

#### 8) Price

With a price tag of $249, AirPods Pro is $50 more expensive than an Apple Watch 3 and
$80 cheaper than a new iPad.

However, considering there are no alternatives with all of these features on the market,
I have to say the price is acceptable.

#### 9) Spy Mode

AirPods come with an accessibility "feature" that will allow you to transmit your sound
from your iPhone's microphone directly into your ears. You can basically put your
iPhone in another room in your flat, and listen to what's going on in that room.
[Here](https://knowtechie.com/how-to-airpod-listening-device/)
is a tutorial on how to enable this feature.

#### Conclusion

Apple has made a great pair or earphones and noise cancelling is the cherry on
top. The sound quality is good and switching between devices is a breeze. Charging
case is easily pocketable and provides plenty of battery life. My only concern is
the high entry price for these earphones but I don't see any cheaper alternatives
with all of these features. When you have no competitors, you are allowed to
keep the price high.

Moral of the story is:

#### Earphones have changed a lot since the last 3 years.

The future of earphones is certainly interesting. I think this technology is going
to get cheap pretty fast. I wonder what the next generation is going to bring...
